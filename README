simple x11 clock thing and whatnot

requires: xlib, xft and fontconfig PLUS a font of choice in the list

configuration is all done in clock.c at the top of the file (fight me)

run make or make install to get it over with, come back to configure

for fun if you run with -f it will fullscreen on your first display

inspired by rsclock
